    description: '''
      ATLAS is a particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that is searching for new discoveries in the head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy.
      ATLAS will learn about the basic forces that have shaped our Universe since the beginning of time and that will determine its fate.
      Among the possible unknowns are extra dimensions of space, unification of fundamental forces, and evidence for dark matter candidates in the Universe.
      Following the discovery of the Higgs boson, further data will allow in-depth investigation of the boson's properties and thereby of the origin of mass.

    description: '''
      Oxford has been leading the world in physical sciences for more than 700 years.
      The laws of motion of falling bodies were first worked out by the “Oxford Calculators” in the 14th century.
      Today, the physics department at the University of Oxford builds, operates and analyses results from high-tech components of telescopes, particle physics detectors and satellites.
      In the images you can see the cylinders of the semiconductor tracker of the ATLAS detector.
      These precision detectors were assembled in Oxford before shipping to CERN.
      They continue to be operated by Oxford graduate students based at CERN.
